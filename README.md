# 💤 LazyVim
Used lazyvim because I set up my own config before, and it got borked and I couldn't be bothered to set up neovim from scratch all over again. 
A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
